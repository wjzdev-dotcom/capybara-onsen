## 📖 Project Overview
"Capybara Onsen" is an infinite logic puzzle game developed using an **AI-First workflow**.
Unlike traditional procedural generation, this project uses a **Hybrid Architecture**:
1.  **Creative Entropy (AI)**: Google Gemini 1.5 generates the "Seed", theme, and atmosphere.
2.  **Deterministic Logic (Code)**: A local Python algorithm guarantees 100% solvability using "Inverse Pulling" logic.

### Key Features
* **♾️ Infinite Levels**: Never play the same map twice.
* **👻 Ghost Mode**: Prevents soft-locks by allowing players to walk through walls if stuck.
* **↩️ Undo Stack**: Full state management for player convenience.
* **⚡ Low Latency**: Powered by FastAPI for instant level generation.

## 🤖 How AI Built This System
This project strictly adheres to the **AI-Only Coding Policy**.
* **Code Generation**: 100% of Python (FastAPI) and JavaScript logic was generated by **Gemini 1.5 Flash** & **ChatGPT**.
* **Debugging**: Error logs (e.g., 404s, CORS issues) were fed back into the LLM for self-correction.
* **Assets**: Pixel art concepts were designed via prompts and finalized for the grid system.
* **[📄 Read the Prompt Engineering Log](docs/prompt_log.md)** (See how I guided Gemini from failure to success)
* **[⚠️ View the Error & Reflection Log](docs/error_log.md)** (Analysis of API failures and hallucinations)

### Tech Stack
* **Backend**: Python, FastAPI, Uvicorn
* **AI Model**: Google Gemini 1.5 Flash (via `google-genai` SDK)
* **Frontend**: HTML5 Canvas, Vanilla JavaScript
* **Deployment**: Dockerized on Render / Google Cloud Run
